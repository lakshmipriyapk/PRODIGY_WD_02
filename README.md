Description
The task is to create a stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application includes features to start, stop, reset, and record lap times. The user interface consists of a display for the elapsed time, control buttons for interacting with the stopwatch, and a section to list recorded lap times.


Usage
Starting the Stopwatch:


Click the "Start" button to begin the stopwatch.
The button text will change to "Stop" indicating that the stopwatch is running.
Stopping the Stopwatch:


Click the "Stop" button to pause the stopwatch.
The button text will change back to "Start".
Resetting the Stopwatch:

Click the "Reset" button to reset the stopwatch to 00:00:00.
All recorded lap times will be cleared.
Recording Lap Times:


Click the "Lap" button to record the current elapsed time.
The lap times will be displayed below the control buttons.


Result
When you open the index.html file in a web browser, you will see a clean, user-friendly interface with the following elements:


A display area showing the current elapsed time.
Control buttons labeled "Start", "Stop", "Reset", and "Lap".
A section below the control buttons where lap times will be listed.
Using the control buttons, you can start and stop the stopwatch, reset the elapsed time, and record lap times. The elapsed time is displayed in hours, minutes, and seconds, updating in real-time while the stopwatch is running.


Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to create a functional stopwatch web application using basic web technologies. By combining HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, we built an interactive and user-friendly application. The project showcases fundamental web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and interval timing. This stopwatch can be extended with additional features or customized further, providing a solid foundation for more complex web applications.
